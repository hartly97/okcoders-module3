# Week 1 - April 14th

## Angular CLI

### Installation

We'll be using the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) (Command Line Interface) tool heavily in class.

You'll need to install it using `npm`:
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

If you are on a Mac, you may need to add `sudo` before the command.

### Our First App: Hello World

Let's create our first Angular app.  Angular CLI makes this _very_ easy: `ng new helloWorld`

Angular CLI will automatically download and setup all the dependencies for you.

Once it's done, `cd` into the new directory and start your app using `ng serve`.

# Angular Tutorial
Please read over the [Tour of Heroes](https://angular.io/tutorial) Angular tutorial.

Don't worry, it's a lot of new material and we'll cover it all in class.  But seeing it before class will make it easier to grasp in class.
